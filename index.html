                            <h2> Ayush Gupta of Indirapuram Public School scored 99.4% marks to claim the third position in the CBSE Class 10th board exams. And when he is not studying, he loves reading books and guiding others. Here are some words of wisdom from this wise lad.

To what do you owe your success? How did your teachers and parents help you achieve this feat?

>> I owe my success to the teachers of my school, Indirapuram Public School, for providing guidance at every step. They helped by giving regular feedback on my progress and by providing their valuable inputs wherever required. They were always attentive to the needs of every student in the class. The parents helped in a unique way by not stressing us about our studies. They advised me to take study as a part of life and not as life .

How did you manage your physical and mental health during the exam season?

>> If I talk about my physical health, then I did not manage it much. For my mental health, I usually went out whenever I would be too much worked out and in stress. I used to sleep well in the night instead of revising the whole night. This made my mind fresh for the next day and with this I managed my mental health. The parents helped in a unique way by not stressing us about our studies. They advised me to take study as a part of life and not as life.

In todayâ€™s world, there is always more to do than you could possibly get done. How did you create a balance in your life?

>> There was not much balance in my exam life as I was very much inclined towards studies but I used to go outdoors sometimes to maintain some balance in my exam life.

Social media is a big distraction nowadays. How did you ensure that it did not negatively affect your performance?

>> I am not active on social media and do not have any accounts on Instagram, Facebook, etc. So it did not have any effect on me during the exam time.

Can you share your success mantra in a few words?

>> My success mantra is not very complex. The reason behind my success is that I studied the way I wanted to without much planning and over exertion. This is how I was able to achieve my success. </h2>
